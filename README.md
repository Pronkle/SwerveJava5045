# SwerveJava5045
An attempt by me to create swerve drive code for our team using Java
This is only really drivetrain code, components like shooter and intake, etc. will not be included. 
Notes: (To be Added)

NOTE: This is currently being put off! Comp season exists, so i gotta do things there first, but I'll come back to this during summer or maybe late spring 2023!!
